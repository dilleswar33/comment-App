I have used MERN Stack to build the required modules.
    Also I have used MongoDB Atlas as database and given access to ever IP adress


To Run the App Please follow below Steps:

Step:1
      First Please Install The Node Modules required for the Application to run in both BackEnd & FrontEnd
          Node Modules can be installed by  npm install command in the terminal at the folder location
Step:2
      After Installing,To run the Application provide the command
            npm start in FrontEnd
            npm run Stsrt in Backend
Step:3
      The FrontEnd will run in localhost:3000
      BackEnd will be running at localhost:4000
Step:4
      After initialization it will redirect to http://localhost:3000 
      if not please copy paste the above url
Step:5
      Now you can be able to access the application in localhosts and 
      SignUp and SignIn Yourself.
